================================ Questions ==================================

1. 
   If only "int" type was used for the input, then the maximum number of commas needed would be 3.

2.   
   Yes, I had to implement a special case for the input of zero because my algorithm would not have outputted 0.

3.
   The most challenging part for me was isolating each digit, but I eventually figured that out by dividing the number by 10 to the power of 1 minus the number of digits. Using that number, I then did temp % 10, which would give me each digit.



4. 
    I did not use the programming idioms, but having looked over them now, I think the isolating digits idiom would have at least helped me get a better idea of how to isolate each digit, since that was the part I had the most trouble with.
