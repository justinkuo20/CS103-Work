================================ Questions ==================================

1. I used a while loop because the number of inputs is unknown, so the best way to iterate through was using a for loop.
   


2. In order to find the proper divisors for a single input, I used a for loop because a for loop allows the divisor to increment each time.

   
3. 
   The first idiom that I used was the divisibilty/factor idiom because in order to find the abundance, the divisors of a number need to be found,    then added together. This was used in my for loop, where I found each sum.

   One idiom that I used was the swapping idiom, since that was required in order to be able to rank the top 3 abundances.

   Another idiom that I used was the shifting values idiom. This is used when a number was found to be greater than the one already stored, so the    new sum had to overwrite a previous sum. This was used in my program each time when a later value was found to be larger than one that was in  t    he n1-n3 variables.
