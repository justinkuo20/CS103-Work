NOTE: You can delete the questions, we only need your responses.

NOTE: It is helpful if you write at most 80 characters per line,
and avoid including special characters, so we can read your responses.

Please summarize the help you found useful for this assignment, which
may include office hours, discussion with peers, tutors, et cetera.
Saying "a CP on Tuesday" is ok if you don't remember their name.
If none, say "none".

: I went to a TA's office hours on a Thursday afternoon, 
and they helped me implement my getBestScore function,
as well as the main logic of the game.

================================ Questions ==================================

1. Did you use the 'suit', 'type' and 'value' arrays? What functions are easier
to implement when using these arrays? How do you use them?

: No, I did not use the given arrays, but the printCard function 
would be eaiser to implement if the arrays are used. 

2. Did you add any additional functions to your implementation? If so briefly
describe how the functions improved your solution.

: No, I did not add any new functions to my program.

3. There are many ways to shuffle the deck of cards. The method used in our
implementation generates a permutaion of the cards to shuffle. For an array of
size N, how many swap (exchange) operations does this algorithm do? Does the
algorithm require any extra memory to generate a permutation?

: For an array of size N, N-1 swap operations are done.
The algorithm does not require any extra memory.
